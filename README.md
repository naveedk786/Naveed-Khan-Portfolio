## DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

## [1.	Credit Card ML Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/naveedk786/Credit-Card-Anomaly-Detection)
*	Team leader: led Anomaly Detection model for a client to detect fraudulent credit card transactions that can be applied as a Real Time application.
*	Additional tools were also developed to prevent credit card holders to exceed their credit limits.
*	Analyzed various anomaly detection techniques: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and compared them for the accuracy.
*	Optimal anomaly detection technique was presented to the client along with key recommendations to enhance fraud detection capabilities and development of additional data features collection for future model enhancements.
## 2.	Secondary Car Market ML Prediction
*	Developed a price prediction model for the secondary car market.
*	The model was created to assist secondary car sellers to be able to quickly and accurately price cars to increase profit margins. 
*	Developed a regression machine learning algorithm to predict sales price of future cars. 
*	Analyzed various ML regression models.
*	Optimal regression model was presented to stakeholders along with recommendations to increase and improve their dataset in order to develop a stronger machine learning model.
## 3.	AAA Northeast Member Analysis (in-progress)
*	Developing a ML model to provide a market segmentation of AAA members.
*	Optimum model will allow AAA Northeast to maximize targeting members to purchase their various products.
*	Developing a series of “look-alike” models to determine the probability of purchasing each product.  
*	Performing Clustering analysis to define members segmentation.
