## Project: Credit Card Anomlay Detection
1.	Developed an Unsupervised Learning Anomaly Detection model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions that can be applied as a Real Time application.
2.	Data set of 230k credit card transactions was used.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed to visually analyze the statistical information of the data.
4.	Performed Data cleaning, Data conversion and Feature Selection to reduce dimensionality.
5.	Used Geocoder API to establish Geodistance for transaction locations.
6.	Performed Feature Engineering to design new features. 
7.	Built Isolation Forest model to identify Anomaly score of each sample.
8.	Compared Isolation Forest model against Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for accuracy and error detection.
9.	Performed Time Series analysis to detect suspicious transactions.
10.	Developed additional models to identify when credit card holders exceeding their credit limits.
11.	Technical Summary presented to the client with the results and key modeling assumptions. Also, provided recommendations to enhance fraud detection capabilities and additional data features collection for future model enhancements.
