## VISUAL DATA SENSEMAKING
An interesting journey to the exciting world of data visualization. It’s an art that needs to be learnt and perfected with continuous learning. You need to be a visual thinker to imagine how data speaks to you and apply scientific techniques to interpret and transform them into an easy to follow visuals. I have read many literatures on this topic and one of my last favorite read was by a wonderful author, Stephen Few. His new book, [Now You See it](https://books.google.com/books/about/Now_You_See_It.html?id=_NgVzgEACAAJ), really explained the principle concept behind the data and visualization using modern graphs to find and examine the meaningful patterns and relationships that reside in quantitative data. I was also fortunate enough to connect with Stephen during my review of his book and able to exchange our thoughts on his excellent work.

Thanks to my mentor, [Mo Medwani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/medwani/) on Data Science, I was invited to present the summary of this book to the [Big Bang Data Science Institute](https://www.bigbang-datascience.com/) in February 2022 during their Data Science Bootcamp week for Data Visualization foundation training. It was an honor and remarkable gesture by Mo Medwani to allow me to share my experience and understanding of this topic to his class.
