## DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

###  [1. Credit Card ML Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/naveedk786/Credit-Card-Anomaly-Detection)
*  Team leader: Architected an Agile Unsupervised anomaly detection ML model for fraudulent credit card transactions. Able to flag 20% of 233k transactions as anomalous. 
*  Developed algorithms and prevented 9 to 15% credit card holders to exceed their credit limits.
*  Performed Feature Engineering and Feature Selection using Geocoder APIs.
*  Analyzed and compared various anomaly detection model: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and compared for the accuracy. Achieved 91% accuracy with Isolation Forest.
*  Presented optimal anomaly detection technique to the client along with key recommendations to enhance fraud detection capabilities and development of additional data features collection for future model enhancements.

###  [2. Secondary Car Market ML Prediction](https://github.com/naveedk786/Secondardy-Car-Market-Analysis)
*	 Developed and optimized ML Regression model to predict secondary car market pricing.
*  Trained and tested data and compared using various regressions models like, Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forrest, Ridge, Lasso, KNN and Elastic Net.
*  Obtained 68 to 78% accuracy on test data set.
*  Summarized and presented optimal Regression model and future model improvement plan


###  [3. AAA Northeast Member Analysis (in-progress)](https://github.com/naveedk786/AAA-Northeast-Member-Analysis)
*	 Developing a ML model to provide a market segmentation of AAA members.
*	 Optimum model will allow AAA Northeast to maximize targeting members to purchase their various products.
*	 Developing a series of “look-alike” models to determine the probability of purchasing each product.  
*	 Performing Clustering analysis to define members segmentation.
